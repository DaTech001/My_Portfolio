        "Project Date: December, 2025 \n\n PROJECT SHOWCASE: NUEL PETROGAS ENERGY \n\nAs a lead developer and designer I was contacted by Nuel Petrogas Energy, I spearheaded the creation of a dynamic online presence through website development, graphic design, and social media projects.

Below is an overview of the projects, the skills applied, and the valuable experience gained.\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW:\n\nüîÑ Website Development: The Nuel Petrogas Energy website serves as the digital cornerstone of the company, providing a professional platform to showcase its services in oil and gas exploration, production, and distribution.

        "Project Date: May, 2023 (3 mons) & December, 2024 (2 mons). \n\n PROJECT SHOWCASE: CITIZENS‚Äô HEALTH EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE (CHEDI) \n\n As a web developer and socail media manager I was entrusted to work for  Citizens‚Äô Health Education & Development Initiative (CHEDI), I designed and implemented a robust online presence through the development of the organization‚Äôs website and the management of its social media campaigns. These projects were crafted to enhance CHEDI‚Äôs visibility, promote its mission of improving healthcare access and education in Nigeria, and engage stakeholders effectively. Below is an overview of the projects, the technical skills applied, and the professional experience gained.\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW: \n\nWebsite Development: The CHEDI website serves as a digital hub for the NGO, registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission since 2012, to communicate its commitment to addressing inadequate preventive healthcare information for communicable diseases (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., cancer, hypertension). The website features a responsive, user-friendly interface with sections for About Us, Reports, Contact, and Donation options, enabling stakeholders to learn about CHEDI‚Äôs initiatives, such as maternal and newborn health programs and youth empowerment projects funded by partners like the World Bank and the Japanese Embassy. The site ensures accessibility across devices, providing a seamless experience for users in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nSocial Media Projects: I developed and executed social media strategies across platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to amplify CHEDI‚Äôs outreach. The campaigns highlighted key initiatives, such as the FY2023 Empowerment Program for 60 youths in FCT, Nasarawa, and Niger States, and success stories like Amina‚Äôs maternal health journey and a beneficiary‚Äôs barbering salon in Keffi. Content included updates on CHEDI‚Äôs partnerships with organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Japanese Embassy, fostering engagement with donors, communities, and health advocates.\n\nEXPERIENCE GAINED:\n\nTechnical Expertise: Strengthened proficiency in Frontend web development  to deliver a high-performance website tailored to an NGO‚Äôs needs. Gained experience with WordPress integration for dynamic content management, enhancing the website‚Äôs functionality for non-technical users. \n\n Digital Outreach: Developed a nuanced understanding of social media strategies for NGOs, learning to craft compelling narratives around health and education initiatives. Improved skills in targeting diverse audiences, from donors (e.g., World Bank staff) to local communities, and leveraging analytics to boost engagement for campaigns like the FY2023 youth empowerment program. \n\n Problem-Solving: Addressed technical challenges, such as optimizing website performance for users with limited internet access. Adapted social media content to align with CHEDI‚Äôs mission while navigating platform-specific constraints, such as Twitter‚Äôs character limits. \n\nStakeholder Collaboration: Worked closely with CHEDI‚Äôs leadership, including Chief (Mrs.) Akunna Enyioha, to ensure the website and social media campaigns reflected the organization‚Äôs goals, such as reducing maternal and infant mortality. Honed skills in translating stakeholder feedback into actionable digital solutions, fostering trust and alignment. \n\n Sector-Specific Insights: Gained a deeper understanding of the NGO sector, particularly in health and education, by showcasing CHEDI‚Äôs transformative work, such as maternal health programs and youth empowerment initiatives. Learned to align digital projects with social impact goals, emphasizing accessibility and inclusivity for vulnerable populations in Nigeria. \n\nIMPACT AND REFLECTION: \n\n The CHEDI website and social media projects significantly enhanced the organization‚Äôs ability to communicate its mission and impact. The website provides a professional, accessible rendering of CHEDI‚Äôs work, from maternal health programs to youth empowerment, attracting partners like the Japanese Embassy and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Social media campaigns have increased engagement, sharing success stories like Amina‚Äôs safe delivery and the Keffi barber‚Äôs financial independence, thereby strengthening CHEDI‚Äôs community and donor relationships. \n\n Through these projects, I advanced my technical and strategic skills in web development and digital marketing, gaining a deeper appreciation for the role of technology in social impact. The experience of working with an NGO like CHEDI, dedicated to health and education since 2012, taught me the importance of user-centric design and targeted outreach in underserved regions. I am now better equipped to deliver impactful digital solutions for mission-driven organizations, with a focus on accessibility, scalability, and stakeholder alignment.",
